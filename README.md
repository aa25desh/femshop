## Welcome to FEMSHOP

 femSHop is a community-oriented  framework  that  is *lightweight, portable, robust, extensible*, and *scalable* and that adapts to the complexity and heterogeneity of modern computing architectures. Our focus in this proposal is to establish a high-productivity framework for advanced high-order discretizations that effectively use small to large-scale computing systems.
